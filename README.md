# Learning Golang

Hello! As I learn and explore the Go programming language, I would like to share my progress with you. I have organized my learnings into separate chapters, which cover a range of topics from foundational concepts such as variables and data structures, to more advanced topics like goroutines and concurrency. By sharing my learnings with you, I hope to help others who are also interested in learning Go, as well as solidify my own understanding of the language.

Here are the chapters:

1. [Go Commands for Efficient Development and Code Quality](go_commands.md)

2. [Streamline Your Go Development with Makefiles](makefiles.md)

3. [Primitive Types and Variable Declaration in Go](primitive_types/primitive_types.md)
